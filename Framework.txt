Frameworks:
What is Frmework: 
FRame work is a semideveloped software, which provides the some common logics which are required for several application develpment.
How can we use frameworks:
it's not like any mobile app', frmeworks we can use as  a jar files and these jar files we have /class files

we need to add these .jar files to build path. so that we can use the common logic in our appliction.


Types of Frame works:
Frameworks are 3 categeries 
ORM Frame work:
These frameworks are used to develope Persistance layer.
Ex: Hibernate
Web Framework:
These frameworks are used to develop Web Components like Controllers, listeners etc

Application Framework:
Ths framework will provide the all the component support to the completete application.
It ill support for Web component as well as Persistance layer.

As discussed above using only hibernate we can't complete one applicaion, we can complee only Persistance layer 
Similarly using struts we can complete only weblayer, we can't complete the one application.
But using Sprng we can complete the Application developement that why we call it as Application developement layer.

Using J2EE also we can coplte the application development, does it mean is it replacing J2EE, ?
No, Spring is internally using the J2EE, 
Spring providing the abstaction layer for J2EE, 

Here our application classes will talk to Spring classe and internally Spring classes will talk to J2EE
