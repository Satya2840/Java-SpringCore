Spring DAO / Spring JDBC module is used to develop Persistence layer
Using JDBC also we can comunicate with DB, then why we need Spring DAO
problems: load the driver
get the connection
create the statement 
execute teh statement/Query
close the connection

we need to write this all the time and using JDBC we will write lot of boiler plate code, 
to avoid this Spring DJDBC came into picture
Internally Spring JDBC will talk ti JDBC API and JDBC will talk to Databse
Advantages:
No need to load the Driver
No need to get the Connection
No Need to cretae the Statement
No need to Close the Connection
We just need to Execute the Query

Spring Web MVC Module is Used to develop web application
Spring Web MVC is developed on top of the Servlets , it's used to simplify web application development

Spring ORM module is used to develop persistance layer

ORM-
It is used to represent tje data in the form of Objects

in JDBC we represent the Data in the form of text
